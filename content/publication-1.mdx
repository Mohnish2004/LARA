# InterACT: Inter-dependency Aware Action Chunking

## Abstract
This research presents a novel approach to bimanual manipulation using hierarchical attention transformers. Our work focuses on understanding and modeling the inter-dependencies between actions in complex manipulation tasks.

## Introduction
Bimanual manipulation remains one of the most challenging aspects of robotics, requiring precise coordination and understanding of complex inter-dependencies between actions. Our research introduces a new framework that addresses these challenges through a hierarchical approach.

## Methodology
We developed a hierarchical attention transformer architecture that:
- Analyzes action sequences in bimanual tasks
- Identifies critical inter-dependencies
- Chunks actions into meaningful subsequences
- Optimizes execution through learned patterns

## Results
Our approach demonstrated significant improvements in:
- Task success rate (+25%)
- Execution efficiency
- Adaptability to new scenarios
- Robustness to environmental variations

## Conclusion
The InterACT framework represents a significant step forward in bimanual manipulation, offering a more robust and adaptable approach to complex manipulation tasks.
